We are pleased to announce the Alpha edition of the Open Programmable
Infrastructure (OPI) event that will be held virtually on March 15th and March
16th, 2022 from 8am-1:30pm Pacific Time. This is an exciting opportunity to share in the
various community efforts underway to make infrastructure fully programmable
across software and hardware devices such as IPUs, DPUs, or switches.

You can add the events to your calendar [here](/opievents.ics).

The event schedule and speaker list is provided below.

| 1   | Meta | Coming soon | Coming soon |
| 1   | Lightbits | Coming soon | Coming soon |
| 1   | Debo Dutta, Nutanix | MLOps Meets Programmable Infrastructure | Coming soon |
| 1   | Ian Wells, Cisco | How Programmable Infrastructure Can Enable Better Edge Computing | Edge Computing has become a hot topic recently. This talk will level set on what Edge Computing is, and then present a world where programmable infrastructure can make edge computing better. The talk will provide the programmable infrastructure community an oppurtunity to build software for this use case. |
| 1   | Tim Michels, F5 | DPU Disruption of Todayâ€™s Infrastructure Paradigm | Explore with F5 the exciting potential for DPU technology to bring disruptive change to the infrastructure and topology of the data center, private cloud, or edge deployments of the future.  Learn to define what a DPU is, how it can be used to separate infrastructure services from application workloads, and why this is so important.  Hear the call to action to drive this technology into the future by creating an open community engaged in the definition of frameworks and APIs targeting vendor-agnostic interoperability. |
| 1   | VMware | Coming soon | Coming soon |
| 1   | Kyle Mestery (Intel), Kris Murphy (Red Hat), Paul Pindell (F5) | Next Steps in Community Building/Evolution | We will talk about where OPI goes next in terms of it's community governance. |
| 2   | IBM | Coming soon | Coming soon |
| 2   | Ericson | Coming soon | Coming soon |
| 2   | Tom Nadeau, Spirent | The Importance of Testing In Your Open Source Infrastructure Project | Join Tom as he discusses why testing is important in your Open Source project, and how it can better enable programmable infrastructure. |

| 2   | Kyle Mestery (Intel), Kris Murphy (Red Hat), Paul Pindell (F5) | Closing thoughts | Why is standardization important for the end-users, the 3rd party vendors integrating with these devices, and ultimately for the vendors of these devices. We will touch on this topic and also have a call to action for the community to join with us in this endeavor. |
