<b>NOTE: The Diamond Bluff Project is being archived as it merges with IPDK into the [OPI Project](https://opiproject.org)</b>

The objective of the Diamond Bluff initiative is to foster a community-driven
standards-based open ecosystem for next generation architectures and frameworks
based on DPU/IPU-like technologies.
